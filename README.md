# RooFitExplorer

This is a tool to interactively visualize RooFit workspaces and aims to be a 'RooFit graphical browser'. It grew out of the need to navigate a [RootFit](http://roofit.sourceforge.net/) workspace more easily and with a graphical interface.

It is currently in alpha stage but has already been used to provide useful visualization of contents of RooWorkspace objects.

Snapshots of binary files are made available on the [releases page](../../releases). The jar files provided there can be run from the command line (tested on OSX and Linux) as:

    java -jar rooFitExplorer-....jar [ options ]
